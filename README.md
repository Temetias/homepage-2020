## Contributing to the blog
I'm open for publishing articles from others to the blog. Submitting to the blog can be done via a PR. Just take a look at the existing posts and mimic the header-info for the .md and start hammering text. ðŸ˜Š Images should preferably be served from 3rd party sources but using the static folder is fine for now too.

## Contributing code
Contributions / issues are welcome in case you spot bugs. ðŸ˜Š
